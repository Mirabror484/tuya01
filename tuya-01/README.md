This integration is a copy of the official Tuya integration for Home Assistant changed to include the status of Tuya locks via cloud (does not implement commands). It will be maintained until the features are added to Home Assistant.

To use, just install via HACS and restart Home Assistant. You don't need to remove the official Tuya integration from your Home Assistant.

If you want to stop using it, just uninstall the integration in HACS. It is not necessary to remove the Home Assistant integration (after uninstalling and restarting the official integration it works again with the same settings).

Not removing the integration ensures that entity ids will be kept as per your customizations.
